Welcome to the source code for my [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website.

It's powered by a wonderful [Jekyll theme](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) by [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com). Please give the man a [hand](https://www.paypal.me/daattali/20).

The repo was originally forked from [here](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), but it didn't make much sense to keep it that way, since I only forked to make grabbing all the theme files easier. All of the base work on the Jekyll is properly credited to Dean & contributers, whereas site content is my own.
