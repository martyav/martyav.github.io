  I'm Marty Hernandez Avedon. I'm a dev with a background in graphic design and writing.  

  In a previous life, I made pins, flyers, banners, posters, and cartoons for a variety of small nonprofits and businesses around NYC, such as [Community Health Action of Staten Island](https://www.chasiny.org/) and [Everything Goes Book Cafe](http://www.etgstores.com/bookcafe/).  		

  I'm now a proud graduate of Coalition for Queens, a 10-month long tech fellowship that taught me the ins and outs of iOS and Swift. I am also a [Grow With Google] (https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/10/grow-with-google-scholarships.html) scholarship recipient, currently learning Android development on the Intermediate track at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google).  

  I like old school video games, zoology, monsters, and digging through whatever Wikihole I've currently tumbled into.
