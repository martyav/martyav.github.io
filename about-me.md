Hey, I'm Marty. 

In a previous life, I made pins, flyers, banners, posters, and cartoons for a variety of small nonprofits and businesses around NYC, such as [Community Health Action of Staten Island](https://www.chasiny.org/) and [Everything Goes Book Cafe](http://www.etgstores.com/bookcafe/). I also ghostwrote numerous short articles for sites such as Amazon and AskJeeves.

I'm now a proud graduate of [Coalition for Queens](https://www.c4q.nyc/accesscode), a 10-month long tech fellowship that taught me the ins and outs of iOS and Swift. 

In early 2018, I received a [Grow With Google](https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/10/grow-with-google-scholarships.html) scholarship, to learn Android development via [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google). However, my studies became interupted in the best way, when I took an offer to move to Seattle and join the [Microsoft LEAP](http://www.industryexplorers.com/) program.

I like old-school video games, zoology, monsters, and digging through whatever Wikihole I've currently tumbled into.

You can find me on Github at [martyav](https://github.com/martyav), and on Twitter at [MHA_from_NYC](https://twitter.com/MHA_from_NYC). If you want to get in touch more directly, you can send me a comment via the [Contact](https://goo.gl/forms/GAB9KQMxD9bRsiK83) page.
