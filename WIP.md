If you're seeing this, you've clicked on a link I have not yet fully implemented.  

I decided to revamp my [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) site on [January 30, 2018](https://martyav.github.io/2018-01-30-first-post), and am currently converting pages that were originally in HTML to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).  

If you're still seeing this page in March, please kick me.
