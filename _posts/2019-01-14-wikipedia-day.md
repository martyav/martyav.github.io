On Sunday, I attended the [Wikipedia Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Wikipedia_Day_2019) meetup sponsored by Wikimedia NYC, in Manhattan. We were celebrating in advance of Wikipedia's birthday on January 15th.

We had bagels, cake, and a full day of lightning talks and presentations.
