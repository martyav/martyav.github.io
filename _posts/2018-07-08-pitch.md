At the end of the program, we had to present our projects at a hiring fair. I made a slideshow (using Powerpoint, of course), and decorated a trifold with Courier New, azure card paper, and print-outs of my data visualization work. I also prepared some talking points, some resumes, and some business cards.

That was back on June 28th, but it feels ages ago.
