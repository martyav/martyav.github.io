title: "Even More Moving"
---

Between [last post](https://martyav.github.io/2018-03-27-hello-seattle/) and this one, I was able to land housing. I'd been living in temporary housing since late 2015, so, needless to say, I'm very relieved. I spent the weekend going back and forth from Target.

The new place is very small, and came with a bed, a desk, and not much else. It's centrally located, though, so I'm no longer traveling two or three miles out just to pick up groceries. 

Even more importantly, my name is on the lease, there's a nice lock on the door, and I'm not sharing the space with anyone.

It's brand new and everything is very clean and in working order. I don't think I've ever lived in a building made past 1970 before...one place I stayed in was so old it had a tub near the kitchen sink for scrubbing laundry in.

Besides moving logistics, which has heavily occupied my mind, we also did our first group project. We started work on it before we had covered best practices for writing testable and maintainable code, so it was kind of a scramble, as everyone was at different places in terms of knowledge and experience. 

We're on the second project now, and not only have we covered, as a class, [SOLID](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) and other best practices, but we are also working off of a pre-made codebase, so we don't have to roll our own objects.

As a [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) coder, I'm familiar with [working with protocols](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/swift/protocol-oriented-programming-in-swift), so learning about [interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface), [overrides](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override), and [abstract classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/abstract) seemed like a breeze. 

Actually implementing that knowledge with a new codebase, though, is kind of heady, especially since I'm still not too familiar with C# syntax. 

It looks like we'll be getting plenty of practice...
