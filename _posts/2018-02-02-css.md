title: CSS Selectors & Styling
---

When I started using [Beautiful-Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll), I really enjoyed the airy, modern feel of the layout. Then I looked around a little at other sites using the same theme...and they all looked exactly like my site. There was absolutely no personal touch.  

Since this is, indeed, my *personal* site, and my readers deserve an idea of what sort of designer I am, I've been busy working on the CSS styling.  

The basic layout is still standard Beautiful-Jekyll, but I've been playing with typefaces, colors, and spacing to make the site feel a little more like home. 

This has been pretty easy, overall, though Jekyll has styling spread out across multiple files, so it's sometimes been a hunt to find where I need to go to change things. 

For example, if you want to specify a [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/about), you need to put the link to the stylesheet in the layouts directory, then call it in the CSS file *or* in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/). Also, inter-paragraph spacing involves messing with [CSS](http://smad.jmu.edu/shen/webtype/indent.html) and [the parser](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/gfm.html).
