title: Site Update
---

I've decided to update my website to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/), a static site generator. 

I've had a lot of exciting things happen in my life lately, but the old site — coded entirely by hand in HTML/CSS the old-fashioned way — was unwieldly to alter. I've simply been too focused on mobile development (among other things) to give it the web dev love it needed.  

I am hopeful that the ease of using Jekyll and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) will allow me to update more regularly. I certainly do have plenty of material. 

I've been sharing loads of bookmarks with students, posting tutorials and notes, and sending links about events and job openings with people, but I haven't had a centralized place to host any of these. With a site that's a lot easier to edit and add pages to, I can get a bit more organized and pretend it's 2007 again, running my hot new web blog.

Project pages are, unfortunately, down for now — at least until I can set up redirects, convert the old pages to Markdown, and get the images uploaded. In the meantime, you can still view all my projects on [Github](https://github.com/martyav).
