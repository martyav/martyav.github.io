We'll be at [the Atrium](http://atrium.lincolncenter.org/) at [Lincoln Center](http://www.lincolncenter.org/visit/getting-here) this time, since [Housing Works](https://www.housingworks.org/locations/bookstore-cafe) is hosting an event.

If you want to come on by, RSVP [here](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/508084aaba72ca7fd0-react).
