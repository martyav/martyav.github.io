title: "React Native Study Group Kickoff"
---

Last night was the inaugural meeting of the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) study group. It was a raining for most of the day, but [Housing Works](https://www.housingworks.org/locations/bookstore-cafe) gave us a nice, friendly space to talk, code, and do prep work on projects. 

We're a mixed group, coming from both web and mobile backgrounds, some with CS degrees and some without. I hope to have regular meetings every other week. If you're interested, send me [a message](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf81AES2NkFGQAHRKIUuGwlIoG5OJfmnzV0VbNtUDDzXIKxzg/viewform) and I'll give you a link to the Slack.

In other news, I have a first round interview with a big tech company coming up next week! I'm trying to get into their apprenticeship program. I had applied weeks ago, just to give it a shot — I am applying the lottery principle of "Hey, you never know" — and had almost forgotten about it until I received the email on Monday. 

Wish me luck!
