title: Filling Out Menus
---

For the past two days, I've been busy adding links to the navbar menus. It's now a lot easier to find my work when you need it (no more searching through repos), *and* you no longer see that nasty WIP page if you click on anything.

I also adjusted colors for links, navigation items, and the banner image, but you probably don't care about that very much.

Finally, yesterday, I attended the Android@Scale conference in Manhattan. It's part of the [@Scale series](https://atscaleconference.com/), sponsored in part by Facebook.

I'm still new to Android, and hearing how professional developers at big companies do their work was very enlightening and exciting. It definitely gave me a good idea of where the industry is right now, in terms of popular libraries and frameworks. It also taught me a lot about workflow at big tech companies, the importance of testing, and, of course, the challenges of shipping fast, performative, reliable code for a very large and international userbase. I especially enjoyed the talks about [StrictMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode.html) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) migration. 

I said that I would post my notes from the conference later that evening, but that was a lie. I was exhausted. I will, however, try to type my notes up soon and post them as a separate blog post.
