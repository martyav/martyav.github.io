title: New Post On Renegade Coder
---

I've been feeling sick lately, so updates have been slow, but I have a new post up on the revamped Renegade Coder. It covers Swift syntax via Fizz Buzz. Check it out [here](https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/projects/fizz-buzz/swift/)!

In other news, my internship is starting tomorrow.... I don't have much to report yet. I'll have my first video meeting with my mentors on Wednesday. I plan to spend tonight and tomorrow reviewing articles and working on my timeline.
