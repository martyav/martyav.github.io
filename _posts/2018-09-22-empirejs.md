title: EmpireJS & Slides
---

On Thursday and Friday, I attended [EmpireJS](https://2018.empirejs.org), thanks to a diversity scholarship. I was delighted to get tickets, and the conference didn't disappoint. A single-track conference focused on Javascript and web development, talks covered not merely the mechanics of coding, but also ethics, history, and how to improve your workplace dynamic by being a better ally. 

EmpireJS was the friendliest tech event I've been at in ages. In addition, it was the first non-LGBTQ tech event I've attended which had out nonbinary people speaking and in leadership roles. It was truly a fantastic experience.
