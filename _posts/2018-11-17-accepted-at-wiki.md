title: Accepted Wikimedia Foundation Internship
---

After a month of hard work updating and improving articles on Mediawiki's APIs, and writing Python sample code making GET requests, I found out that I'll be [interning with the Wikimedia Foundation](https://twitter.com/Wikimedia/status/1063552591701848064). 

Over the course of the winter into early spring, I'll be working on 40 to 50 articles describing how to use Mediawiki REST APIs, as well as developing a web app to demonstrate how to use them. 

I'm excited because it's a project that has the potential to really help people learn how to code. Many bootcamps and beginner programming classes use the APIs to teach students how to use REST and parse JSON...but the docs and code samples currently available are not always very clear. I'll be working to fix that! 

I'll be starting in Decemeber, but in the meantime, I have to tighten up my proposal's deadline, add a RSS feed to this blog, and sharpen up my Python skills. 

I'm excited to be working on such a meaningful project, and being back on track, focusing on web development in Javascript and Python. My mentors, Srishti Sethi and Sarah Rodlund, have both been very patient in their explanations and a tremendous help. I think this internship will be a great learning experience, and I hope to add great value to the Mediawiki team.
