title: "Moving & Changing"
---

So, a few weeks ago, I casually mentioned interviewing for a large tech company. I tried not to get too excited about it, since I've interviewed at a lot of companies since last April. 

As it turns out, I am currently being onboarded as an apprentice/contractor at this large tech company. I'm studying up on my [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/introduction-to-the-csharp-language-and-the-net-framework), and have already booked a flight out to Seattle in the middle of March.

I'm definitely a little nervous, since I've never moved outside of NYC before. I've lived on my own here and there, but mostly I've been with friends, lovers, or family. You better believe I've been reading up on Seattle: the demographics, the climate, where to find good takeout...

C# is also definitely a change, but in a lot of ways, it feels similar to Java (static void Main!) and to Swift (optional chaining!) I'm honestly not that worried about learning it. I'm more concerned with getting set up in Seattle and adjusting to the move right now. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm studying carefully...but all of my family and friends are in New York City. I grew up here. I thought I'd get a tech job here. Seattle's smaller and greener and I've never even visited before. It's kind of a risk, but I'm excited to be moving on to the next stage of my life.
