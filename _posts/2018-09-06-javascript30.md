Yesterday, I started the [#Javascript30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) series, and learned a bit more about user interactions and web animation. The first project is an in-browser drum kit. I refactored it a bit, changed the styling to make the page more attractive and accessible, and posted my work over at [https://martyav.github.io/drum-kit/index.html](https://martyav.github.io/drum-kit/index.html).

Enjoy!

The main difference between mine and the original is that mine accepts click events as well as keyboard input. This way, if you don't have access to a keyboard, you can still bang on the drums. I have the lingering feeling that I could have written the event handlers in a cleaner way, but I will continue to refactor as I learn.
