This is a list of resources I gathered while attending [LEAP](http://www.industryexplorers.com), an apprenticeship program sponsored by Microsoft. Among other things, I built a feature on [SREBot](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon17asia/program/presentation/guimaraes). 

Unfortunately, many of the links I bookmarked while I was at Microsoft won't work unless you have internal corporate access, so I've only included the ones that are available to the public. 

If you want to know more about my time at LEAP, I wrote some blog posts, starting [here](https://martyav.github.io/2018-02-28-moving-and-changing/).
